/*
Have the function OneDecremented(num).
Count how many times a digit appears that is exactly one less than the previous digit. 
For example: if num is 5655984, then your program should return 2 because 5 appears
directly after 6 and 8 appears directly after 9. 
The input will always contain at least 1 digit.

Sample test cases:
Input:  56
Output: 0
Input:  9876541110
Output: 6

for (i=0; i<num.length; i++) {
  if (num[i]-num[i+1] === 1) {
    count++;
